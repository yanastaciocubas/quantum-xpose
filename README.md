# 🔐 Quantum Pose  
### *Exposing hidden threats through the lens of quantum security.*


---

## 🧭 Overview  
**Quantum Pose** explores how quantum computing can **expose, simulate, and defend against cybersecurity vulnerabilities**.  
The project uses **quantum algorithms** to model real-world attacks and **quantum-inspired defenses** to visualize how information integrity can be preserved in the post-quantum era.

## 💡 Concept  
As the world moves toward quantum supremacy, traditional cryptography becomes increasingly vulnerable.  
**Quantum Pose** creates an interactive and visual framework where users can:

- 🔍 **Visualize** the process of breaking small cryptographic keys using Shor’s Algorithm.  
- 🧠 **Experiment** with Grover’s Search to understand quantum speed-up in brute-force attacks.  
- 🛡️ **Simulate** post-quantum encryption strategies (e.g., lattice-based, hash-based).  
- 📊 **Compare** performance and resilience between classical and quantum systems.
